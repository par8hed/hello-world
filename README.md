# hello-world
Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Dee Medlin and I am very interested in the Accounts Support position.
I bring years of experience supporting products and services working directly with customers.  I have the patience and
wisdom to de-escalate a tense situation and create a positive experience resulting in a happy customer.  I love to help
people by teaching and mentoring which is a talent I bring to any position I have held.  I am a veteran at working
remotely and responsibly manage my time.  I am a searcher by nature and am very comfortable looking for answers but also
not afraid to ask for assistance.  I have a pretty extensive tech background which is why I love support roles not only
to help customers but also impact process improvements and software development.  I have experience with webinars and
documenting procedures or processes.  I am a quick learner and always willing to apply myself.  I enjoy collaborating
with a team and bouncing ideas around when looking for solutions or learning something new.
